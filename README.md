naive lasso R package (altered from STAT 327 003 HW 2)


This is a naive R package that solve lasso problem with penalty 2, and I use "optim" function in r with methods "Nelder-Mead" (i.e. I did nothing actually) , since I set penalty value as a fixed value 2. It's nothing different from simple linear regression, I'll improve it whenever I had time.
